# process_monitoring_system
Project that involves an application aimed at monitoring a tubular reactor for the hydrolysis of Triolein in Free Fatty Acids (FFA). The operating conditions of the reactor are entered in it and the application makes a prediction in ANNs to identify the percentage of conversion and production of FFA and suggests what can be improved in the process.
